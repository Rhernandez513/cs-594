### 1. Summary of the paper. Do I like it? Hate it? Why?

// TODO Add like / hate / why

For over 30 years, system calls have been the standard interface for applications to request services from the operating system kernel. Traditionally implemented as synchronous, these calls negatively impact performance in system-intensive workloads due to issues like pipeline flushing and pollution of key processor structures. The paper suggests a solution called exception-less system calls, aiming to improve processor efficiency by offering flexibility in scheduling OS work. This leads to enhanced temporal and spatial locality of execution, reducing pollution effects on processor structures. The proposed mechanism, implemented in FlexSC for Linux, particularly benefits highly threaded server applications like web servers and database servers. FlexSC demonstrates performance improvements in Apache (up to 116%), MySQL (up to 40%), and BIND (up to 105%), without requiring modifications to applications.

"free hand" Review:

The paper begins by providing good data collected for the performance cost of system calls and interrupts, including the amount of processor instructions performed after an interrupt over time.  This data demonstrates that the impact of system performance cause by system calls is not insignificant.

The main technique introduced by the paper is to use a reserved space in memory called a syscall page and async syscall threads to handle requests.  The implementation is designed such that application programs do not need to change their interfaces to syscalls, though are responsible for checking the syscall page for completion which can be an additional challenge for developers, akin to event based programming.

To support this async execution, the paper introduces the concept of syscall threads which are best scheduled on a separate code from executing user space threads.  The implementation FlexSC uses batching of system calls by default to improve temporal locality in memory to great effect.

The paper then goes on to provide some performance data and results with system intensive programs that are recognizable to many programmers, Apache2 and MySQL, demonstrating significant performance improvement on both.  Using four cores, Figure 11 specifically shows Apache throughput using FlexSC achieving almost double the throughput to traditional system calls.

One fault of the paper is that it stressed that both Apache2 and MySQL did not need modification, though it mentioned that application programs using FlexSC would need to handle async system calls.  It was not clear by the end of the paper why specifically Apache2 and MySQL did not need modification after section 4.2 discussing threads.  Generally speaking, the clarity of the writing is high, and to a reader like myself who is not intimately familiar with the intricacies of the Linux kernel or its system call methods, it was relatively easy to follow.  I only found 1 spelling mistake, the figures were easy to understand, although the tables could have benefited from using less acronyms for clarity.


Generally speaking, the paper gave me enough of a basis to be curious about the real world adoption of an exception-less system call paradigm through FlexSC and itâ€™s potential significant performance improvement that can be delivered across application programs.
