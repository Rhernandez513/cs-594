# hw1 - Readiness Exercise

### 1.
Explain why the output of the following code snippet is 0.
``` 
unsigned int i = 0;
printf("%u", i--);
```


[your answer]

Because we use a postfix decrement operator here so the value is printed first before the decrement.

### 2.

Explain why the output of the following code snippet is "char=1, int=4, long=8" in x86 (64-bit).

```
printf("char=%d, int=%d, long=%d", \
  sizeof(char), sizeof(int), sizeof(long));
```

[your answer]

Data type sizes are determined by the architecture, which are fixed in hardware.  In x86-64 we have:
1 byte => 8 bits
word=2 bytes
int=4 bytes
long=8 bytes

### 3.
Explain why the output of the following code snippet is "st0 = 8, st1 = 8".

```
struct st0 {
  int x;
  char y;
};
struct st1 {
  int x;
  char y;
  char z;
};
int main()
{
  printf("st0 = %d, st1 = %d\n",
  sizeof(struct st0), sizeof(struct st1));
}
```

[your answer]

```

```

It would seem to be based on the compiler output that the reason the sizes of the structs are the same is because the underlying data structures are "unsigned long", it would seem that one of (compiler, hardware, OS kernel) assign an unsigned long as the minimun size for a struct.

### 4.

Explain why the output of the following code snippet is 0xEF.

```
int64_t v = 0xdeadbeef;
printf("%02x", ((char *)&v)[0]);
```

[your answer]


### 5.
 Explain why the output of the following code snippet is "i=5, j=10".
```
int main ()
{
  int i, j, *p, *q;
  p = &i;
  q = &j;
  *p = 5;
  *q = *p + i;
  printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i, j);
  return 0;
}
````

[your answer]


We declare four variables: i and j are integers, and p and q are pointers to integers.

Then the addresses of variables i and j are assigned to pointers p and q respectively.

Then we assign value 5 to the variable i through the pointer p.

The value of i (5) is added to the value pointed to by p (also 5 p points to i). The resultant value (10) is then assigned to the variable j through the pointer q.


Thus the output will be "i=5, j=10" 


### 6.

Explain why the value of NULL (64-bit) is 0x0000000000000000.

[your answer]

NULL being 0x0000000000000000 is a convenient representation of a null pointer, and it follows the convention of representing zero in hexadecimal notation.


### 7.

Explain why the output of the following code is 0x124000.
#define PGSIZE 4096
#define CONVERT(sz) (((sz)+PGSIZE-1) & ~(PGSIZE-1))
printf("0x%x", CONVERT(0x123456));

[your answer]

First we define the page size as 4096

Then we define a "CONVERT" macro that uses an arguement "sz" and does:
```
(((0x123456)+4096-1) & ~(4096-1))
```


which in english is:

(0x123456) + 4096 - 1 evaluates to 0x124551.

This step ensures that if sz is not already a multiple of PGSIZE, it is increased to the next multiple of PGSIZE.

```
& ~(4096-1) 
```
performs a bitwise AND with the bitwise negation of `(4096-1)`. This step ensures that the result is rounded down to the nearest multiple of PGSIZE.

The final result is 0x124000, which is the rounded-up multiple of PGSIZE for the input 0x123456.


So, the printf statement prints "0x124000". This type of operation is used in memory management, where it ensures that memory allocations are aligned to the page size.


### 8.

 Assuming the first printf results "1 = 0x7fffdfbf7f00", explain why the rest of the output is as follows:
2 = 0x7fffdfbf7f04
3 = 0x7fffdfbf7f00
4 = 0x7fffdfbf7f14
main() {
  int x[5];
  printf("1 = %p\n", x);
  printf("2 = %p\n", x+1);
  printf("3 = %p\n", &x);
  printf("4 = %p\n", &x+1);
  return 0;
}
